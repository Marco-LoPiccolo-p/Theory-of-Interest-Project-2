```{r}
#The values for the term payments of 10 were set to n, L is the loan size and i is the effective annual interest rate
n <- 10
L <- 200000
i <- 0.03

#The annual effective rate is converted to a monthly rate so that monthly payments will be made
monthly_rate <- (1+i)^(1/12)-1

#The monthly payment size is calculated so that the payments are made each month for the loan
Payment_Size <- (L * monthly_rate)/(1-(1+monthly_rate)^(-120))

#Since the loan is being paid each month the amount of terms is multiplied by twelve to change the amount of payments made
n <- 120

amortization_table <- c(0, 0, L)
